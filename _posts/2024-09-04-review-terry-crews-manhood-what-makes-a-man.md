
Terry Crew's first book *Manhood: How to Be a Better Man - or Just Live with One* is a biography about his life from being a small boy, via his NFL career, to his current bout as a Hollywood actor.

The book sets out rambling about his childhood, somewhat lacking insights and reflection. Afterward, it blossoms and unpacks an entertaining story about his life. The book should really be understood as a biography, depicting Terry Crew's life. It is fascinating to learn about how being in the NFL still sucks unless you are *THE* superstar, or even after a series of successful features in Hollywood, Terry Crew's life does not magically become an easy cake.

The writing is okay-ish. Terry Crew's manages to keep the tension up throughout the book by convincing alternation between his ups and downs. After each chapter, you without a doubt want to know how he will move on. The book is an easy and quick read, but do not expect great insights into your own life on "what makes a man"â€”it is genuinely just a biography of Terry Crew's life. An entertaining one, though.
