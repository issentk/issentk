
After several months I finally finished John Stillwell's book *Mathematics and Its History*. It is a decent book with a broad range of topics covered. In particular, the history parts are very interesting. For me, as a non-mathematically inclined person, the formulas were tough to understand, especially when reading while tired. And only knowing maths from school in a foreign language did not make it easier.

Interesting note: 40 pages of bibliography!

Definitely recommend for people with an interest in Maths and Its History. Although it is a long read.
