
The autobiography is extraordinary. It’s honest. Inspiring. Emotional. Katalin Kariko (and her editorial team) take her writing as seriously as her science. The book spills many insights into Katalin Kariko’s meticulous work, her ups and downs, and she manages to weave her life into an exciting narrative where you cannot drop the book. Insights into the precarious status quo of science are offered as she describes the tale of her life. It’s definitely a good read for anyone interested in autobiographies and science. Some sections are pretty technical when she describes how her science works.
